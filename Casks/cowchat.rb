  # The formula of the same name installs the `cowchat` and `cowchat-server`
  # CLIs; this cask installs the app, which carries its own server helper in
  # Contents/Helpers. They coexist — keep both on the same version so a server
  # started from the app and one started from the terminal are the same build.

  # ~/.cowchat holds the message database and the local API key, so it is left
